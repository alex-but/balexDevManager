Create a nodejs server to create an API for a basic device management system.
You can use Express as a web application framework and Redis as a database, but it's of your choosing if you use something else.

Devices will consist of basic switches and lights.
Common between them are : Name, On/Off Status.
Lights have Brightness as an added Status.

{
  "Name" : "Switch1",
  "Type" : "Switch",
  "Status" : "on"/ "off"
}

{
  "Name" : "Light1",
  "Type" : "Light",
  "Status" : "on"/ "off",
  "Brightness" : 0-100
}

Using Postman ( or any other tool ), the API must respond to calls that :

1. can create a user
2. delete a user
3. add devices to a user
4. remove devices from a user
5. control on/off status and brightness status.

Optional tasks are welcome
